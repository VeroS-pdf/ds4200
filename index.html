        Hi! My name is Veronica, and I really like cats. I used to be obsessed with dogs, and I would
        legitimately memorize the stories and descriptions of dogs at our local dog shelter. But one day my
        parents broke the heartbreaking news to me that our family could not support caring for a dog.

        That same day, we spontaneously made a visit to Pet Smart and walked out with an orange tabby kitten.

         He unfortunately passed away young due to an incurable kitten disease,
            but not long after my mom's boss had a kitten get dropped off at her farm.

         We picked up the little tuxedo kitten for free and named her Nike! She's been our
         family cat ever since.
